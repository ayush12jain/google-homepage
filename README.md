This project is a part of the The Odin Project Web Development Curriculum. 

Also my first project on Github. Even though it was an simple task, I had trouble applying the CSS properties, espcially the top and bottom navbars. 

Lots of trial and erro and searches on Google later this came up. 

Happy about it though can not figure out how to align the left and right navigations items.
